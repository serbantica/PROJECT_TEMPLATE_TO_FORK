## 🚨 Important Notes

### **Bootstrap Process**
1. **Validates** your environment (Python 3.11+, git, etc.)
2. **Transforms** the template into your project
3. **Installs** dependencies and development tools
4. **Runs** tests to ensure everything works
5. **Cleans up** template files
6. **Commits** changes to git

### **After Bootstrap**
- Template files are removed
- Project is customized with your name
- Ready for immediate development
- All dependencies installed
- Tests passing

## 📋 Next Steps After Bootstrap

1. **Customize Your Project**
   ```bash
   # Edit your project charter
   nano docs/charter.md
   
   # Update project documentation
   nano docs/architecture.md
   ```

2. **Add Your Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Add your specific dependencies
   uv add requests pandas numpy
   ```

3. **Implement Your Features**
   ```bash
   # Add your code in src/
   # Write tests in tests/
   # Update main.py
   ```

4. **Push Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
